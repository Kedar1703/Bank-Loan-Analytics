# Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard Project

## üìä Project Overview

The **Bank Loan Analytics** project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of loan applications, disbursements, and repayments through dynamic Power BI dashboards. By analyzing key metrics such as loan application trends, total funded amounts, average interest rates, and borrower profiles, this project helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions to improve loan operations and customer relationships.

The project includes three dashboards:

1. **Dashboard 1: Summary**
2. **Dashboard 2: Overview**
3. **Dashboard 3: Details**

## üìù Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to monitor and analyze the performance of loan applications and disbursements across various dimensions such as loan terms, regional differences, borrower profiles, and loan purposes. The key insights are visualized using a range of Power BI charts and KPIs that help financial teams make informed decisions and optimize the loan portfolio.

## üí° Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Loan Applications**: Track the total number of loan applications and observe trends Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. **Total Funded Amount**: Measure the total funds disbursed as loans and analyze MTD and MoM changes.
3. **Total Amount Received**: Understand the repayment patterns and cash inflow from borrowers.
4. **Average Interest Rate**: Calculate the average interest rate across loans and monitor trends.
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Gauge the financial health of borrowers with the average DTI.
6. **Good Loan vs. Bad Loan Metrics**: Compare metrics such as application percentages, funded amounts, and amounts received for both good and bad loans.
